---

## Exercise 1: File Manipulation 

### Goal

Create methods to write student information to a text file and read it back to the console.

### Task Description

Develop a Java program named `FileManipulation.java` that implements the following functionality:

1. **Method 1: Write to File**
   - Create a method that generates a text file named `student_info.txt`
   - The file should contain:
     - The student's name on the first line
     - A list of foods the student likes on the second line
   - Save the file to the working directory

2. **Method 2: Read from File**
   - Create a method that loads the contents of `student_info.txt`
   - Print the entire file content to the console
   - Handle the case where the file does not exist

### Expected Console Output

```
Name: Maria Silva
Foods I like: Sushi, Pasta, Ice Cream
```

### Deliverables

- `FileManipulation.java` containing both write and read methods
- Generated file `student_info.txt` in your submission folder

---

## Exercise 2: Matrix and Prime Numbers 

### Goal

Generate a matrix populated with prime numbers and save it to a file based on dimensions read from an input file.

### Task Description

Develop a Java program named `PrimeMatrix.java` that implements the following:

1. **Method 1: Prime Number Detection**
   - Create a method `isPrime(int n)` that returns `true` if a number is prime, `false` otherwise
   - The method should handle edge cases (numbers less than 2)

2. **Method 2: Prime Matrix Generation**
   - Create a method `generatePrimeMatrix(int rows, int cols)` that:
     - Calculates the first N prime numbers (where N = rows × cols)
     - Arranges them in a matrix with the specified dimensions
     - Returns the matrix as a 2D array

3. **Method 3: File-Based Matrix Creation**
   - Create a method that:
     - Reads a file `matrix_config.txt` containing two integers: number of rows and number of columns
     - Generates the prime matrix using the dimensions from the file
     - Saves the resulting matrix to a new file `prime_matrix.txt`
     - Each row of the matrix should be on a separate line with numbers separated by spaces

4. **Display Method**
   - Create a method to print the matrix to the console in a formatted manner

### Input File Format (`matrix_config.txt`)

```

3
```

### Expected Console Output

```
2 3 5
7 11 13
17 19 23
```

### Expected File Output (`prime_matrix.txt`)

```
2 3 5
7 11 13
17 19 23
```

### Deliverables

- `PrimeMatrix.java` containing all required methods
- Input file `matrix_config.txt`
- Generated file `prime_matrix.txt`

## Exercise 3: Object-Oriented Programming 

### Goal

Design and implement object-oriented classes representing authors and books with proper encapsulation.

### Task Description

Create a Java program with the following class structure:

1. **Class: Author**
   - Attributes:
     - `firstName` (String)
     - `lastName` (String)
     - `nif` (String) - National Identification Number
     - `age` (int)
   - Implement:
     - Constructor(s) to initialize all attributes
     - Getters for all attributes
     - Setters for mutable attributes (age can change; NIF should be immutable)
     - A method to return the full name as a single string

2. **Class: Book**
   - Attributes:
     - `id` (int) - immutable unique identifier
     - `title` (String)
     - `author` (Author object)
     - `price` (double)
     - `genre` (String)
   - Implement:
     - Constructor(s) to initialize all attributes
     - Getters for all attributes
     - Setters for mutable attributes (id should be immutable)
     - A method to return a formatted string representation of the book

3. **Main Program**
   - Create a class `BookManagement.java` with a main method
   - Instantiate the following objects:
     - **Author:** José Saramago, NIF: 290116422, Age: 101
     - **Book:** ID: 1, Title: "Ensaio sobre a Cegueira", Author: José Saramago, Price: 25.50, Genre: "Novel"
   - Print information about the book to the console using the book's formatted output method

### Expected Console Output

```
Book: Ensaio sobre a Cegueira by Jose Saramago
```

### Deliverables

- `Author.java` containing the Author class
- `Book.java` containing the Book class
- `BookManagement.java` containing the main program

---

## Exercise 4: CSV Reading and OOP integration 

### Goal

Parse CSV files containing author and book data, create object structures, and perform statistical analysis.

### Task Description

Develop a Java program named `CSVAnalyzer.java` that performs the following operations:

1. **CSV File Reading**
   - Read data from two CSV files:
     - `authors.csv`: Contains author information (firstName, lastName, nif, age)
     - `books.csv`: Contains book information (id, title, authorNif, price, genre)
   - Parse the CSV files and create arrays (or collections) of Author and Book objects
   - Associate each Book with its corresponding Author using the NIF field

2. **Analysis Functions**
   - Implement the following analysis methods:
     
     a) **Find Oldest Author**
        - Identify and return the author with the maximum age
     
     b) **Find Author with Most Books**
        - Count the number of books per author
        - Return the author who has written the most books
     
     c) **Find Most Popular Genre**
        - Count occurrences of each genre
        - Return the genre that appears most frequently
     
     d) **Find Most Expensive Book**
        - Identify and return the book with the highest price

3. **Output Results**
   - Print the results of all four analysis functions to the console in a clear format

### Expected Console Output

```
Oldest author: Jose Saramago (101 years)
Author with most books: Fernando Pessoa
Most popular genre: Novel
Most expensive book: Os Maias (€30.00)
```

## Exercise 5: Object Composition and Relationships

### Goal

Understand and implement composition by creating classes that contain other objects as attributes.

### Task Description

Build upon Exercise 3 by creating new classes that use composition:

1. **Class: Address**
   - Attributes:
     - `street` (String)
     - `city` (String)
     - `postalCode` (String)
     - `country` (String)
   - Implement:
     - Constructor to initialize all attributes
     - Getters and setters for all attributes
     - A method `getFullAddress()` that returns the complete address as a formatted string
     - Override `toString()` method

2. **Class: Person**
   - Attributes:
     - `name` (String)
     - `dateOfBirth` (String)
     - `address` (Address object) - demonstrates composition
     - `phoneNumber` (String)
   - Implement:
     - Constructor accepting all parameters including an Address object
     - Getters and setters for all attributes
     - A method `relocate(Address newAddress)` that changes the person's address
     - Override `toString()` to display person info including address

3. **Class: BankAccount**
   - Attributes:
     - `accountNumber` (String) - immutable
     - `accountHolder` (Person object) - demonstrates composition
     - `balance` (double)
     - `accountType` (String) - e.g., "Savings", "Checking"
   - Implement:
     - Constructor to initialize all attributes
     - Getters for all attributes
     - Setter for accountType only (balance should be modified through methods)
     - Method `deposit(double amount)` - adds to balance if amount > 0
     - Method `withdraw(double amount)` - subtracts from balance if sufficient funds exist
     - Method `getAccountSummary()` - returns formatted string with account details

4. **Main Program: CompositionTest.java**
   - Create:
     - An Address: "Rua das Flores 123", "Lisboa", "1200-001", "Portugal"
     - A Person: "João Santos", "15/03/1990", the address created above, "+351 912345678"
     - A BankAccount: Account "PT50000123456789", holder is João Santos, balance 1500.00, type "Savings"
   - Demonstrate:
     - Printing complete account information (should include person and address details)
     - Depositing 500.00
     - Withdrawing 300.00
     - Attempting to withdraw 2000.00 (should fail)
     - Relocating the person to a new address
     - Printing updated account information showing new address

### Expected Console Output

Address: Rua das Flores 123, Lisboa 1200-001, Portugal

Depositing €500.00... Success!
New Balance: €2000.00

Withdrawing €300.00... Success!
New Balance: €1700.00

Attempting to withdraw €2000.00... Failed: Insufficient funds

Relocating account holder...
New Address: Avenida da Liberdade 456, Porto 4000-001, Portugal

Updated Account Summary:
Account Holder Address: Avenida da Liberdade 456, Porto 4000-001, Portugal
```
